How to Pull an Earnings Transcript (Seeking Alpha API)
🎯 Workflow Overview

List transcripts for a symbol using /transcripts/v2/list to obtain the transcript IDs.

Fetch a specific transcript using /transcripts/v2/get-details with the ID obtained from the first call.

(Optional) You can still use the older /transcripts/get-details endpoint, but it’s marked “Deprecating”; prefer the v2 version.

1. GET /transcripts/v2/list

Retrieves a paginated list of transcripts for a single stock symbol.

Required query parameter:

id – the symbol of the stock (e.g., aapl). Only one symbol is allowed per call

.

Optional query parameters:

until – Unix timestamp (epoch). Use with since to filter transcripts up to this time

.

since – Unix timestamp (epoch). Use with until to filter transcripts starting from this time

.

size – Number of transcripts to return (default: 20)

.

number – Page number (e.g., 1, 2, etc.). Not explicitly shown in UI but present in code snippet (defaults to 1).

Example request:

GET /transcripts/v2/list?id=aapl&size=20&number=1


This returns an array of transcript metadata objects. Each object includes a unique id value that you’ll need to fetch the transcript itself.

2. GET /transcripts/v2/get-details

Fetches the full transcript text for a given transcript ID (returned from the list endpoint).

Required query parameter:

id – the numeric transcript ID obtained from /transcripts/v2/list

.

Example request:

GET /transcripts/v2/get-details?id=4341792


The response contains fields such as title, publishDate, speakers, and content (the full transcript text).

3. GET /transcripts/get-details (Deprecated)

This older endpoint retrieves transcript details similar to the v2 endpoint, but it’s marked Deprecating.

Required query parameter:

id – transcript ID from the legacy /transcripts/list endpoint

.

Example request:

GET /transcripts/get-details?id=4341792


Use this only for backward compatibility; prefer the v2 endpoints.

✅ Putting It Together

To pull an earnings transcript for a stock:

List transcripts by calling /transcripts/v2/list?id=<symbol> and capture the id of the transcript you’re interested in (e.g., the most recent one).

Fetch transcript details by calling /transcripts/v2/get-details?id=<transcript_id>.

Use the returned content to process or display the earnings call transcript in your application.

Note: All requests require RapidAPI headers (x-rapidapi-key and x-rapidapi-host) as shown in the code snippets on the documentation page
